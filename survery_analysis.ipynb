    "Interpretation and Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our hypothesis, which posits that \"Multiple eco-labelling schemes create confusion among consumers in Kenya and fail to promote awareness of eco-friendly products effectively,\" the results of this analysis suggest that there is no statistically significant relationship between encountering multiple eco-labels and the frequency of finding it challenging to understand the environmental implications based on eco-labels. In other words, this specific analysis does not provide strong evidence to conclude that encountering multiple eco-labels leads to a higher frequency of challenges in understanding eco-labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this result is specific to the data and analysis conducted. Several factors may influence consumer perceptions and eco-label effectiveness, and this analysis is just one piece of the puzzle. Further research and exploration of these variables may provide a more comprehensive understanding of consumer behaviors and eco-labeling schemes in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it's worth considering that the non-significant result does not necessarily imply the absence of any effect. It could be influenced by the specific sample size, the choice of survey questions, or other external factors. Therefore, this result should be considered in conjunction with other research findings and real-world observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding context and discussing the implications, your research report will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the results and their significance within the broader research landscape.\n"
