# Chi-Squared Testing for Hypotheses 

This README provides an overview of the Chi-squared testing conducted in relation to three hypotheses. Each hypothesis focuses on different aspects of consumer behavior and perceptions in Kenya. We will explain the components of Chi-squared testing and the results for each hypothesis.

## Understanding Chi-Squared Testing

Chi-squared testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is an association or dependency between two categorical variables. It assesses whether the observed distribution of data differs from the expected distribution under the assumption of independence. In the context of Chi-squared testing, there are several key components:

- **Contingency Table**: A contingency table is a tabular representation of data that categorizes and cross-tabulates two or more categorical variables. It is a fundamental component of Chi-squared testing.

- **Chi-Squared Statistic**: The Chi-squared statistic measures the strength of association between the categorical variables. It is calculated by comparing the observed and expected frequencies in the contingency table.

- **P-value**: The p-value represents the probability of obtaining the observed relationship (or a stronger one) between the variables by random chance, assuming there is no actual association. A low p-value suggests a significant relationship.

- **Degrees of Freedom**: Degrees of freedom indicate the number of categories or cells in the contingency table that are free to vary. It is a key parameter in Chi-squared testing.

## Hypothesis 1

**Hypothesis 1**:
"Do multiple eco-labelling schemes create confusion among consumers in Kenya and fail to promote awareness of eco-friendly products effectively?"

### Chi-Squared Testing Components

**Questions Used**:

- "I am confident in my ability to distinguish between different eco-labels when shopping for products.": This question helps assess whether consumers encounter multiple eco-labels on similar products, a key aspect of eco-label confusion.

- "How often do you find it challenging to understand the environmental implications of a product based on its eco-label?": This question evaluates how often consumers find it challenging to understand the environmental implications of a product based on its eco-label, which relates to the effectiveness of eco-labels.

**Justification**:
These questions were chosen because they directly pertain to the central idea of Hypothesis 1, which is to understand if multiple eco-labelling schemes lead to confusion among consumers and hinder the promotion of eco-friendly products. By examining how frequently consumers encounter multiple eco-labels and the challenges they face in understanding these labels, the analysis can provide insights into the hypothesis.

- **Chi-Squared Statistic**: The Chi-squared statistic measures the strength of association between these two variables. Actual Chi-squared Statistic: 6.154.

- **P-value**: The p-value represents the probability of obtaining the observed relationship (or a stronger one) between the variables by random chance, assuming no actual association. Actual P-value: 0.104.

- **Degrees of Freedom**: In this case, there were 3 degrees of freedom, corresponding to the number of categories or cells in the contingency table that are free to vary.

### Hypothesis 1 Results

- At a 95% confidence level, the p-value was approximately 0.104, which is greater than 0.05. This suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Hypothesis 2

**Hypothesis 2**:
"How much trust do consumers place in products that bear the KEBS label when it comes to quality and safety?"

### Chi-Squared Testing Components

**Questions Used**:

- "Have you intentionally purchased products with the KEBS label because of its perceived quality and safety standards?": This question assesses whether consumers intentionally purchase products with the KEBS label based on perceived quality and safety, which directly relates to trust.

- "How much trust do you place in products that bear the KEBS label when it comes to quality and safety?": This question measures how likely consumers are to choose a product with the KEBS label over a similar product without it, which also reflects trust in KEBS-labeled products.

**Justification**:
These questions were selected because they address the central theme of Hypothesis 2, which is the trust consumers place in products with the KEBS label. By examining intentional purchase behavior and the likelihood of choosing KEBS-labeled products, the analysis can provide insights into consumer trust.

- **Chi-Squared Statistic**: The Chi-squared statistic measures the association between these variables. Actual Chi-squared Statistic: 12.001.

- **P-value**: The p-value indicates the significance of the results. Actual P-value: 0.0173.

- **Degrees of Freedom**: There were 4 degrees of freedom for this analysis.

### Hypothesis 2 Results

- At a 95% confidence level, the p-value was approximately 0.0173, which is less than 0.05. This suggests strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Hypothesis 3

**Hypothesis 3**:
"To what extent do consumers associate the KEBS label with government oversight and regulation?"

### Chi-Squared Testing Components

**Questions Used**:

- "To what extent do you associate the KEBS label with government oversight and regulation?": This question evaluates the extent to which consumers associate the KEBS label with government oversight, which is a core element of the hypothesis.

- "Do you believe that products with the KEBS label are more reliable and safer than those without it?": This question assesses consumer beliefs in the reliability and safety of KEBS-labeled products, which ties directly to government regulation.

**Justification**:
These questions were chosen because they directly align with the central idea of Hypothesis 3, which is to understand the extent of consumers' association of the KEBS label with government oversight and whether they believe KEBS-labeled products are reliable and safe due to regulation.

- **Chi-Squared Statistic**: The Chi-squared statistic measures the association between these variables. Actual Chi-squared Statistic: 49.326.

- **P-value**: The p-value indicates the significance of the results. Actual P-value: 0.0000000004992.

- **Degrees of Freedom**: There were 4 degrees of freedom for this analysis.

### Hypothesis 3 Results

- At a 95% confidence level, the p-value was approximately 0.0000000004992, which is significantly less than 0.05. This provides strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Conclusion

Chi-squared testing has provided valuable insights into the three hypotheses, shedding light on consumer behavior, perceptions, and trust. These findings are essential for regulatory bodies, businesses, and organizations involved in quality assurance, labeling, and eco-friendly product promotion.
