# Chi-Squared Testing for Hypotheses 

This README provides an overview of the Chi-squared testing conducted in relation to three hypotheses. Each hypothesis focuses on different aspects of consumer behavior and perceptions in Kenya. We will explain the components of Chi-squared testing and the results for each hypothesis.

## Understanding Chi-Squared Testing

Chi-squared testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is an association or dependency between two categorical variables. It assesses whether the observed distribution of data differs from the expected distribution under the assumption of independence. In the context of Chi-squared testing, there are several key components:

- **Contingency Table**: A contingency table is a tabular representation of data that categorizes and cross-tabulates two or more categorical variables. It is a fundamental component of Chi-squared testing.

- **Chi-Squared Statistic**: The Chi-squared statistic measures the strength of association between the categorical variables. It is calculated by comparing the observed and expected frequencies in the contingency table.

- **P-value**: The p-value represents the probability of obtaining the observed relationship (or a stronger one) between the variables by random chance, assuming there is no actual association. A low p-value suggests a significant relationship.

- **Degrees of Freedom**: Degrees of freedom indicate the number of categories or cells in the contingency table that are free to vary. It is a key parameter in Chi-squared testing.

## Hypothesis 1

**Hypothesis 1**:
"Do multiple eco-labelling schemes create confusion among consumers in Kenya and fail to promote awareness of eco-friendly products effectively?"

### Chi-Squared Testing Components

- **Contingency Table**: For Hypothesis 1, the Chi-squared test was conducted using a contingency table. The table contained two categorical variables: "Encountering Multiple Eco-Labels" and "Challenges Understanding Eco-Labels."

- **Chi-Squared Statistic**: The Chi-squared statistic measures the strength of association between these two variables.

- **P-value**: The p-value represents the probability of obtaining the observed relationship (or a stronger one) between the variables by random chance, assuming no actual association.

- **Degrees of Freedom**: In this case, there were 3 degrees of freedom, corresponding to the number of categories or cells in the contingency table that are free to vary.

### Hypothesis 1 Results

- At a 95% confidence level, the p-value was approximately 0.104, which is greater than 0.05. This suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Hypothesis 2

**Hypothesis 2**:
"How much trust do consumers place in products that bear the KEBS label when it comes to quality and safety?"

### Chi-Squared Testing Components

- **Contingency Table**: For Hypothesis 2, a contingency table was used with two categorical variables: "Intentional Purchase of KEBS-Labeled Products" and "Likelihood of Choosing KEBS-Labeled Products."

- **Chi-Squared Statistic**: The Chi-squared statistic measures the association between these variables.

- **P-value**: The p-value indicates the significance of the results.

- **Degrees of Freedom**: There were 4 degrees of freedom for this analysis.

### Hypothesis 2 Results

- At a 95% confidence level, the p-value was approximately 0.0173, which is less than 0.05. This suggests strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Hypothesis 3

**Hypothesis 3**:
"To what extent do consumers associate the KEBS label with government oversight and regulation?"

### Chi-Squared Testing Components

- **Contingency Table**: For Hypothesis 3, a contingency table was used with two categorical variables: "Association of KEBS Label with Government Oversight" and "Belief in Reliability and Safety of KEBS-Labeled Products."

- **Chi-Squared Statistic**: The Chi-squared statistic measures the association between these variables.

- **P-value**: The p-value indicates the significance of the results.

- **Degrees of Freedom**: There were 4 degrees of freedom for this analysis.

### Hypothesis 3 Results

- At a 95% confidence level, the p-value was approximately 0.0000000004992, which is significantly less than 0.05. This provides strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Conclusion

Chi-squared testing has provided valuable insights into the three hypotheses, shedding light on consumer behavior, perceptions, and trust. These findings are essential for regulatory bodies, businesses, and organizations involved in quality assurance, labeling, and eco-friendly product promotion.
