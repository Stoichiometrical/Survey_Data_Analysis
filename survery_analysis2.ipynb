    "# Interpretation of Chi-Squared Test Results for Hypothesis 1\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis 1 postulates that multiple eco-labelling schemes create confusion among consumers in Kenya and fail to promote awareness of eco-friendly products effectively. To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted a Chi-squared test to examine the relationship between consumers' confidence in distinguishing between different eco-labels and their frequency of finding it challenging to understand the environmental implications of products based on eco-labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-squared Test Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-squared Statistic: 23.637\n",
    "P-value: 0.0228\n",
    "Degrees of Freedom: 12\n",
    "Expected frequencies table:\n",
    "Rows: Confidence in Distinguishing Eco-Labels\n",
    "Columns: Frequency of Finding Eco-Labels Challenging\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "With a 95% confidence level, corresponding to a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, we sought to be 95% confident in our conclusions. The p-value obtained in our Chi-squared test is approximately 0.0228, which is less than 0.05. This suggests that there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification for Selected Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The two questions used in this analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am confident in my ability to distinguish between different eco-labels when shopping for products.\"\n",
    "\"How often do you find it challenging to understand the environmental implications of a product based on its eco-label?\"\n",
    "Question Justification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: This question assesses consumers' confidence in distinguishing between different eco-labels. It is pertinent to Hypothesis 1, as it directly explores consumers' perceptions and confidence regarding eco-labels, a key element in the context of eco-friendly products. Consumers' confidence can influence their behavior and choices when it comes to eco-labeled products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: This question investigates the frequency with which consumers find it challenging to understand the environmental implications of a product based on its eco-label. It is directly related to the hypothesis, as it measures the perceived effectiveness of eco-labels in conveying environmental information. If consumers frequently find it challenging to understand these implications, it aligns with the hypothesis that eco-labeling schemes may create confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation and Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistically significant association revealed by the Chi-squared test suggests a relationship between consumers' confidence in distinguishing eco-labels and the frequency of finding it challenging to understand the environmental implications of eco-labeled products. This finding holds important implications for eco-labeling strategies and consumer awareness of eco-friendly products in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "It indicates that the effectiveness of eco-labels, in terms of consumers' comprehension and confidence, is a significant factor that should be considered in eco-labeling schemes"
