    "# Interpretation of Chi-Squared Test Results for Hypothesis 1\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis 1 postulates that multiple eco-labelling schemes create confusion among consumers in Kenya and fail to promote awareness of eco-friendly products effectively. To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted a Chi-squared test to examine the relationship between consumers' confidence in distinguishing between different eco-labels and their frequency of finding it challenging to understand the environmental implications of products based on eco-labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-squared Test Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-squared Statistic: 23.637\n",
    "P-value: 0.0228\n",
    "Degrees of Freedom: 12\n",
    "Expected frequencies table:\n",
    "Rows: Confidence in Distinguishing Eco-Labels\n",
    "Columns: Frequency of Finding Eco-Labels Challenging\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "With a 95% confidence level, corresponding to a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, we sought to be 95% confident in our conclusions. The p-value obtained in our Chi-squared test is approximately 0.0228, which is less than 0.05. This suggests that there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification for Selected Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The two questions used in this analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am confident in my ability to distinguish between different eco-labels when shopping for products.\"\n",
    "\"How often do you find it challenging to understand the environmental implications of a product based on its eco-label?\"\n",
    "Question Justification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: This question assesses consumers' confidence in distinguishing between different eco-labels. It is pertinent to Hypothesis 1, as it directly explores consumers' perceptions and confidence regarding eco-labels, a key element in the context of eco-friendly products. Consumers' confidence can influence their behavior and choices when it comes to eco-labeled products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: This question investigates the frequency with which consumers find it challenging to understand the environmental implications of a product based on its eco-label. It is directly related to the hypothesis, as it measures the perceived effectiveness of eco-labels in conveying environmental information. If consumers frequently find it challenging to understand these implications, it aligns with the hypothesis that eco-labeling schemes may create confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation and Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistically significant association revealed by the Chi-squared test suggests a relationship between consumers' confidence in distinguishing eco-labels and the frequency of finding it challenging to understand the environmental implications of eco-labeled products. This finding holds important implications for eco-labeling strategies and consumer awareness of eco-friendly products in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "It indicates that the effectiveness of eco-labels, in terms of consumers' comprehension and confidence, is a significant factor that should be considered in eco-labeling schemes"

    "Hypothesis 2 focuses on consumer trust and preference for products bearing the KEBS label in Kenya, particularly concerning quality and safety standards. The Chi-squared test was conducted to explore the relationship between respondents' intentional purchases of products with the KEBS label due to perceived quality and safety standards and their likelihood of choosing products with the KEBS label over similar products without it.\n",

    "At a 95% confidence level, corresponding to a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, the p-value obtained is approximately 0.0173, which is less than 0.05. This suggests that there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence level.\n",

Trust in quality and safety is a critical aspect of consumer preferences.\n",
